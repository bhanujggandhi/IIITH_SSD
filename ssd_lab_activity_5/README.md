For the whole project I have create 2 HTML Files and 2 CSS Files

1. - index.html
   - index.css

2. - studentRecords.html
   - studentRecords.css

index.html is the login page which has a form that will take 2 inputs and upon submitting will redirect to student records page.
Student records page has 2 inputs which takes roll number and name upon pressing add entry it will append the row in the table.

The button at the bottom will delete the last entry from the table.
